# gufaTA core

The gufaTA web shop components can integrate into almost any PHP application and uses the infrastructure of the application for building URLs, caching content, configuration settings, logging messages, session handling, sending e-mails or handling translations.

The "core" extension integrates gufaTA into the Laravel framework and utilizes the native Laravel components for content caching, logging messages, session handling, generating URLs and accessing the user table.

If you are using the Laravel framework, you don't have to install and set up the ai-laravel extension yourself. Instead, use the [gufaTA Laravel package](https://github.com/gufaTA/core) to create a web shop within minutes.

## License

The gufaTA "core" extension is licensed under the terms of the LGPLv3 license and is available for free.
